Day 4: December 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Converted a PSD template to a Bootstrap Templates.

Day 5: December 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Revisited / Covered jQuery.

**Thoughts:** A touch on behaviour and applying it on the template I designed made me realize how an important library jQuery is. Easy to get the hang of coming from a CSS session. Made me realize how important the HTML to CSS and then over to behaviour (JavaScript - jQuery) transition is for aspiring developers and students.

Day 6: December 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Covered jQuery and Completed Building a Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** A revision of jQuery functions got me thinking about the Add to Cart button I see on ecommerce websites and how they function. Building the tribute page got me to learn about image caption, blockquote footer and cite classes, things I never paid attention to before.
