Day 4: December 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Converted a PSD template to a Bootstrap Templates.

Day 5: December 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Revisited / Covered jQuery.

**Thoughts:** A touch on behaviour and applying it on the template I designed mage me realize how an important library jQuery is. Easy to get the hang of coming from a CSS session. Made me realize how important the HTML to CSS and then over to behaviour (JavaScript - jQuery) transition is for aspiring developers and students.
